I'm an English Literature graduate turned dev based in Jakarta, Indonesia. I first dabbled with code on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">Free Code Camp</a> in 2016, and in 2019 after reading and listening to just a "few" success stories, I was convinced that I could become a developer. Since then, I have been continuously learning via courses and any other sources.
