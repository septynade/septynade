I'm an English Literature graduate turned web developer based in Bogor, Indonesia. I wrote my first line of code back in 2016, and in the middle of 2019 I was convinced that I could become a professional developer, or I will die trying. I have a profound interest in Tech, Language, Culture, and everything in its orbit. I believe becoming a developer will oblige me to keep learning and I like learning! I'm currently seeking an opportunity to join a team that will allow me to utilize my abilities and continue learning.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: React.js
