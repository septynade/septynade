I'm an English Literature graduate turned coder based in Bogor, Indonesia. I first dabbled with code on FreeCodeCamp in 2016, and in the middle of 2019 after reading and listening to just a "few" success stories, I was convinced that I could become a professional developer. Since then, I have been continuously learning via courses and any other sources, with a goal in mind; to become a reliable developer.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: iOS Development
